## Git hooks
Run this snippet to enable lint checks and automatic formatting before commit/push.
```
cp pre-push ./.git/hooks/
cp pre-commit ./.git/hooks/
chmod +x ./.git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x ./.git/hooks/pre-push
```

## Certificates

Metamask support suggesting nodes only with https. Install `mkcert` first.

```
mkcert -key-file key.pem -cert-file cert.pem example.com *.example.com
```

## Using in metamask
```
poe dev
```

Use new network with url = `http://localhost:8000` and id = `11` (same as returned from `eth_chainId`).
